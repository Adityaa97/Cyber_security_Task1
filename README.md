Role: Cybersecurity Internship

Description:

During my internship in cybersecurity and ethical hacking, I focused on developing a tool to enhance online security by improving password practices. One of my key projects was creating a Password Strength Checker Tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool aimed to provide users with real-time feedback on their password's strength based on complexity, length, and uniqueness.

Key Responsibilities:

Tool Development: Designed and implemented a web-based password strength checker that evaluates passwords against criteria such as length, character diversity, and common patterns.
Frontend Design: Used HTML to structure the tool, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Feature Implementation: Developed features to assess and display password strength dynamically, guiding users to create stronger, more secure passwords.
Testing and Optimization: Conducted thorough testing to ensure the tool's accuracy and performance across different browsers and devices.
Documentation: Created detailed documentation for the tool, including user guides and technical specifications.
Skills Acquired:

Web Development: Gained hands-on experience in frontend web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and their application in security tools.
Security Awareness: Enhanced understanding of password security principles and best practices.
Project Management: Developed skills in managing and executing a project from concept to deployment.
This experience significantly contributed to my knowledge of web security and ethical hacking practices, and provided practical skills in developing tools to support cybersecurity efforts.
